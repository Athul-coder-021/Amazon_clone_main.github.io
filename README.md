# Amazon_clone_main.github.io
Description: 
I have created a remarkable Amazon.com clone using HTML and CSS only. This project aims to replicate the user interface of the popular e-commerce platform, Amazon, with a focus on showcasing my front-end development skills. The clone includes key features such as product listings, search functionality, product details, user authentication, and a shopping cart. By utilizing HTML and CSS, I have crafted a visually appealing webpage, that closely resembles the original Amazon website.
